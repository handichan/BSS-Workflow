-- rerun if there have been updates to res_ann_hvac
-- res_ann_hvac defines the grouping characteristics for hvac (e.g. ER heating with AC to ES HP, HP heating to ultra high eff HP, fossil heating without cooling to high eff HP)
-- potential reasons to update res_ann_hvac
    -- add new cooling load when installing a HP to houses without cooling in the baseline
    -- disaggregate by new characteristics (e.g. building type, LMI status)
-- after making the new table, run 'res delivered heat.sql' to add the groups for secondary heating
